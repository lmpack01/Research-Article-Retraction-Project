### Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to collect and process data related to retracted published academic literature from the PubMed database. This data will be used to create an NLP model that will be able to determine the subject matters that are most likely to be retracted after publishing as well as predict if a paper will be retracted based on its body of text. Several metrics will be used to assess the performance of the model, including accuracy. 

If time allows, a web-based application will be made that allows you to put in the text of a paper and determine the likelihood of the paper to be retracted. 

This project is important to researchers, as researchers would be able to determine if a paper they create needs to be edited to avoid common retraction reasons, such as plagiarism. Additionally, editors of journals could use the model in this project to quickly determine if a newly submitted article needs to be looked over closely before publishing. 

For the general public, this project shows the topics or scientific methods that are more likely to be retracted. By having a healthy conversation about the dynamics of retraction, we can build a greater trust between the general public and the scientific community.
